</h1></div>
<!-- badges: start -->

<p>The package <em>shoredate</em> offers methods to shoreline date coastal Stone Age sites based on their present-day elevation and the trajectory of past relative sea-level change. Shoreline dating is based on the premise that coastal Stone Age sites in large parts of Fennoscandia were located on or close to the shoreline when they were in use. The package and method as implemented here was originally developed for the Norwegian Skagerrak coast in south-eastern Norway, based on an empirically derived estimate of the likely elevation of sites above sea-level when they were occupied (Roalkvam 2023).</p>
<p>While the package offers ways to extend and adjust the method for application in other areas which have been characterised by a monotonic trajectory of relative sea-level regression, the ways and degree to which the procedures are directly applicable elsewhere is largely undetermined and likely to vary between contexts. Do also note that as the method is dependent on regularities in human behaviour, and as the Roalkvam (2023) study provides an initial formalisation of the method, it is hefted with unexplored uncertainties, also within the core area for which it was developed. In sum therefore, the dates achieved with the package should be treated with care.</p>

</h2>
<p>As the method of shoreline dating is determined by relative sea-level change, it is dependent on reliable geological reconstructions of this development. The method as outlined here was therefore originally developed for the Skagerrak region of south-eastern Norway – extending from Horten in the north east to Arendal in the south west (see figure below). This region has newly compiled shoreline displacement curves for Horten (Romundset 2021), Porsgrunn (Sørensen et al. 2014; Sørensen et al. 2023), Tvedestrand (Romundset 2018; Romundset et al. 2018) and Arendal (Romundset 2018). The region also formed the study area for Roalkvam (2023), in which the method and its parameters were derived. The remainder of this document and the <a href="https://isakro.github.io/shoredate/articles/shoredate.html">main vignette</a> focuses on this area. It is, however, possible to adapt the procedures for application in other regions, which is outlined in the <a href="https://isakro.github.io/shoredate/articles/extending-shoredate.html">second vignette</a>.</p>
<p>The first figure below shows the location of the spatial limit within which the method was originally derived. The shoreline isobases in the second figure represent contours along which the shoreline displacement has followed the same trajectory. These correspond to the displacement curves and place names in the third figure, which also indicates the temporal coverage of the method within the region.</p>
<p><img src="reference/figures/coverage.png" width="90%" height="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>As human occupation only occurred some time after the retreat of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet, the currently oldest known sites in Norway are from around 9300 BCE (e.g. Glørstad 2016). The oldest possible age to achieve with <em>shoredate</em> in the Skagerrak region of south-eastern Norway is 9469 BCE, although no sites are yet known to be that old. A warning is given if a site location is outside the spatial extent outlined above, as this involves a more uncertain extrapolation of the development of shoreline displacement. However, the dating procedure is still performed. Conversely, if a site has an elevation that implies a date older than the lower temporal limit of the displacement curves, it is returned as NA and a warning is given.</p>
<p>In Roalkvam (2023) it was found that sites in the study region tend to be located on or close to the shoreline up until around the transition to the Late Neolithic, c. 2500 BCE, which thus marks the upper limit for the applicability of the method in the region. A date that has a later start date than this is therefore, with the default settings, returned as NA with a warning. The temporal range is indicated by the dashed lines in the plot above that displays the shoreline displacement curves. Additionally, if the probability of a date extends beyond 1950 CE (0 cal BP), thus indicating a site location below the present-day sea-level, this overshooting probability is cut off and the date is normalised to sum to unity.</p>

</h2>
<p>To shoreline date a site, a reconstruction of local shoreline displacement is necessary. There are currently four reliable geological displacement curves available from within the study area. Each of these is associated with a shoreline isobase, along which the trajectory of relative sea-level change has been the same. To find the local displacement curve, the curves are interpolated to a site location using inverse distance weighting, where the default is to weigh the interpolation by the square of the inverse distance between site and isobases.</p>

<p><img src="reference/figures/date-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></p>
<p>The blue gamma distribution on the y-axis represents the likely elevation of the site above sea-level when it was in use, which is described by an empirically derived gamma distribution with the parameters <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> (shape) = 0.286 and <span class="math inline"><em>σ</em></span> (scale) = 20.833. This starts from the elevation of the site. The red envelope is the shoreline displacement curve as interpolated to the site location. The probability from the gamma distribution is transferred to the calendar scale using the displacement curve. This gives the resulting shoreline date in grey, which is underlined by the 95% highest density region (HDR) in black (see Roalkvam 2023 for more details). By default, the shoreline date is normalised to sum to unity. The default resolution on the calendar scale is 10 years.</p>
<p>Calling the date object, which has the custom class <code>shoreline_date</code>, prints the name of the site, its elevation and the HDR:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">target_date</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; ===============</span></span>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; 5880 BCE-5100 BCE</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first column of a data frame beyond the geometry of the spatial objects will be taken to represent site names. If no such column exist, the sites are simply numbered as they are passed to <code><a href="reference/shoreline_date.html">shoreline_date()</a></code>.</p>
