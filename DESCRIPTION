Description: Provides tools for shoreline dating Stone Age sites located on the 
  Norwegian Skagerrak coast using methods presented in Roalkvam (2023) 
  <doi:10.1016/j.quascirev.2022.107880>. Shoreline dating is based on 
  the present-day elevation of a site, a reconstruction of past relative 
  sea-level change, and empirically derived estimates of the likely elevation of
  the sites above sea-level when they were in use. The geographical and temporal
  coverage of the method thus follows from local geological reconstructions of 
  shoreline displacement and the degree to which settlements in the region have
  been found to have been located on or close to the shoreline when they were in
  use. Methods for numerical treatment and visualisation of the dates are
  provided, along with basic tools for evaluating the location of sites within 
  the region and corresponding variation in local shoreline displacement.
